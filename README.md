This Repo is a copy of my path in Codedex.if you want to learn from the very basics ---> visit <a href='https://www.codedex.io/python'>Codedex Web</a>

I'm new to coding but very enthusiastic about this new world. Codedex is a fun way to learn coding. In my case, I chose Python, but there are other languages available too!

As I continue learning, I will add more projects and code snippets here for you all to see. If you have any questions or need help, just let me know!

I'll provide multiple ways to complete the tasks I'm assigned and explain each method as best as possible.

# Tasks:

1. Printing Hello World
2. Variables and some Operators
